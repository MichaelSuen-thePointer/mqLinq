# mqLinq
yet another linq implementation in C++

This is another linq implementation in modern C++, based on C++11 and C++14. It is tested under MSVC 19 (VS2015).
This work is based on @vczh's CppLinq https://github.com/vczh/vczh_toys/tree/master/CppLinq, I rewrote it with new syntax and standard library facilities, and also with some improvements such as SFINAE support.

This repo is just for fulfilling my self-interest and proving my C++ template skill.

## Interfaces
See main.cpp, it contains all test cases.

## Further work
Add more SFINAE support.

Write .natvis file to produce a more friendly view in VS-debugger's watch window.
